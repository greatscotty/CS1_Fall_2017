Classes are like a mold they give a general shape or outline for an object to be made. 

Objects are the liquid and the alterations you make the blank that comes out of the mold. Colour's, glue used, items in the mix. Etc.

    Float Array HistoryOfStockPrice - last 100 or so prices
    String CompanyName
    String CompanyIndustry
}

Class StockPorfolio

    //Attibutes
    Array Stocks - Stock in the Portfolio 
    Float SumofCurrentPrices
}

Function GetSumPortfoliaValue (input Portfolio)
{
    While PortfolioStocks is less than last value. 
        StockPriceSum = StockPriceSum + Stock.CurrentPrice
    
    return StockPriceSum
}
